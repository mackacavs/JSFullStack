## Javascript Cheat Sheet

Over my last few weeks at Makers I've beomce increasingly interested in Javascript and as a way of collating my ideas I created a Full Stack Javascript Cheat Sheet. In this repo you will find the following folders-

* Express
  * Express.md is a simple overview of how to create an express server 
  * simpleExpressApp.js is the code for creating the server
* Mongo
  * Mongo.md is a simple overview of how to use Mongo as the database for your project 
  * MongoCheatSheet.md contains many of the most crucial commands to access information in your Mongo database
  * Idea.js is an example of a model in Mongo/Mongoose
* Templates
  * For the purpose of this tutorial I've used handlebars in order easily show our front-ends

Finally, there is also a file of Node - it gives you a very brief breakdown on how Node allows you to use Javascript outside of the browser
